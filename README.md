# Homework #2 - Relaxr Project

## Overview

Create a landing page and blog for an up and coming startup client. The finished project should closely resemble the designs (provided by the client's design team) depicted in the images below.

The design team has also provided you with specifications that provide you with style information such as font types, font sizes, font colors and background colors.

## Wireframe

- Before you start building your site, you will create a wireframe similar to the one found [here](https://fewd20190318.github.io/04-css-basics/code-along/) to help you plan your layout.


## Website Requirements

- Implement the design specifications provided by the client's design team (see the provided files: landing_page_design_spec.txt & landing_page_blog_spec.txt)

  - **Please Note**: Every style consideration may not have been provided by the client, in those cases use your best judgement and the Finished State Designs (below) as your guide.

- You are only responsible for delivering two (2) pages:

  - landing page (i.e. index.html)

  - blog (i.e. blog.html)

- Visitors should be be able to navigate between the landing page (i.e. index.html) and the blog

- Clicking on the Relaxr logo should navigate visitors to the landing page (i.e. index.html)

- Code for the site should make good use of indentation

- Use flexbox for your layout alignment needs
